# Omnipost Dev Terraform

This stack owns the live Omnipost production-like dev runtime.

DNS records for `omnipost.neuralliquid.ai` are owned by
`neuralliquid-org/infra/terraform/dns`.

## Backend

- resource group: `nl-org-tfstate-rg`
- storage account: `nlorgtfstate`
- container: `tfstate`
- key: `products/omnipost/dev.tfstate`

## Managed Resources

- `nl-dev-omnipost-rg`
- `nl-dev-omnipost-asp`
- `nl-dev-omnipost-web`
- `nl-dev-omnipost-law`
- `nl-dev-omnipost-ai`
- Omnipost metric alerts
- `omnipost.neuralliquid.ai` hostname binding
- `nl-dev-omnipost-kv`
- `nl-dev-omnipost-cae`
- `nl-dev-omnipost-sluice`

PostgreSQL is modeled in Terraform but disabled by default with
`enable_postgresql = false`.

The existing App Service managed certificate remains live in Azure but is not
managed by this first Terraform pass because importing it as
`azurerm_app_service_managed_certificate` forced replacement in the provider
plan. Leave it Azure-managed until a no-replacement import can be proven.

## Secret Inputs

Sluice requires these secret variables at plan/apply time:

- `TF_VAR_sluice_azure_openai_endpoint`
- `TF_VAR_sluice_azure_openai_api_key`
- `TF_VAR_sluice_api_key`

The GitHub workflow maps those from repository/environment secrets named
`SLUICE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `SLUICE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and
`SLUICE_API_KEY`. The dev repo secrets are configured.

## Bicep Status

The active dev runtime path is Terraform. Legacy Bicep deployment is retained
only as a disabled workflow path during quick iteration.

## Commands

```bash
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/env/dev init
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/env/dev validate
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/env/dev plan
```
